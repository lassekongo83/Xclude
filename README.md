# Xclude

Several ways to exclude X/Twitter from your life.

1. Filterlist for uBlock Origin. Add: https://github.com/lassekongo83/Xclude/raw/refs/heads/main/filterlists/xclude-filter.txt to uBO settings > [Filter lists pane](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists) > Import. This will block you from accessing X/Twitter, and also hide some links to X/Twitter.
2. Hosts file. Add: https://github.com/lassekongo83/Xclude/raw/refs/heads/main/hosts/xclude-x-hosts-file.txt to your hosts file, or pi-hole, or whatever. This will block you from accessing X/Twitter.
3. Userscript. Add: https://github.com/lassekongo83/Xclude/blob/main/userscripts/xclude-x-from-search-results.user.js to your preferred user-script manager. This will remove X/Twitter from search results on Google, Bing, Duckduckgo and Ecosia.
